# Frisco Monogram Bitmaps

## About

**2012 Update**: This page and the images here were created back
in the mid 1990's -- the neolithic era of the web. Back then the
1024 pixel wide images here were ginormous. Now they're just meh.
The quality ain't so good, either. But here they are -- use 'em if wish.

A variety of software was used to generate these bitmaps.  First,
a copy of the frisco monogram blueprint (above) was scanned and saved
to a TIFF file.  This file was imported into a pre-production copy of
AutoCAD Release 14, traced, cleaned-up, filled, and exported to a GIF
file. This GIF file was imported into Adobe PhotoShop for further editing.
A public-domain program, GIFTRANS, was used to create the transparent
bitmaps and change the color tables.
